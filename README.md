# Omnibot
## Project
Omni-directional Robot controller design and verification on self-build prototype
## Objective: 
Learn how to design the controller for an Omni-directional Robot and implement it on a prototype using the simulation model. 
## Tasks description:
1. Robot Controller Design: Use ROS2 and MATLAB for Modelling, Simulation and control of the robot (Mobile Robot Modeling)
2. Omni-directional Robot Design: Create 3D models (tentative) with bill of material
3. Build the prototype: Assemble and test the prototype
4. Test and verification: Apply the controller on the prototype and calibrate its configuration (write a test report)
5. Documentation: Write a report and post technical information on Github
